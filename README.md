State of the development
========================
This project has not been update since long time. 
I have no longer a tutsplus premium account, so I cannot update the project to work with the new version of the site.
I don't plan to buy a premium account anytime soon. That's mean that, as rigth now (6 december 2016), **the project will not be updated**.

This is for paid user only!
===========================

Before anything else let's clarify that this script is  for paid users only.

This script will simply don't work if you don't provide a valid username and password. The account you provide must be a valid tutsplus premium's account.

Why this script?
================

Tutsplus already allow us to download their video. In fact in each lesson's page there is a shiny download button.

Because I watch their video mostly offline (during train travelling) I needed a way to bulk download the courses. This script just automates this process.

Installation
=============

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`


Example
========

First thing first make a new file(inside the repos dir) called ```download.py```with the following contents:

```py
#! /usr/bin/env python
#-*- coding: utf-8 -*-

# Importing the module
from Tutsplus import Tutsplus

# Your username and password
username = 'my_username'
password = 'my_password'

# This is a list with all the url for the courses you want to download
courses_url = [
                'https://tutsplus.com/course/say-yo-to-yeoman/',
                'https://tutsplus.com/course/phone-gap-essentials/'
            ]

# Instantiate the main object passing the credentials
t = Tutsplus(username, password)

# This method will download all the courses within the list
t.download_courses(courses_url)
```

run with ```python download.py```
